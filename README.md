## 1. GNPX v5 brings significant improvements to the program.<br>
   GNPX v5 is a development and deployment version of new algorithms. Smartness is secondary.<br>
   There is no continuity with the traditional code in the analysis algorithm part of GNPX.<br>

## 2. The Sudoku analysis algorithm was studied.<br>
   i will explain using an image diagram to explain the logic.(Too specific, it will be difficult to understand the essence)t<br>
  (1) "Locked" in Sudoku analysis<br>
  (2) Extension of ALS (AnLS), extension of algorithm<br>
  (3) Link、network expansion<br>
  (4) Fish family<br>
  (5) SueDeCoq family, SueDeCoq's new algorithm( SueDeCoqEx, Franken SueDeCoq, Finned SueDeCoq )<br>
  (6) DeathBlossom algorithm consideration<br>

## 3. GNPX v5 プログラム<br>
  (1) Improved many analysis algorithms<br>
  (2) Bit representation (change Bit81 to UInt128)<br>
