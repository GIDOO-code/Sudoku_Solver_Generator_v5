                Fish is Locked, which consists of a BaseSet and a CoverSet.<br>
                CoverSet completely covers Baseset. Elements that destroy CoverSet are negatively determined.<br><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Fish(Basic) : (BaseSet,CoverSet) = (2 rows house, 2 columns house) Fish.<br>
                        (The order of row house and column house is not essential.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Size: Fish sizes range from 2 to 7. Each one has a name. Fish of size 5-7 has a dual Fish (size 4-2).</li>
                    <li>
                        Franken/Mutanthouse(F/M) FIsh: Even if the block house is added to the row/column house, Fish is established.
                        BaseSet and CoverSet can be selected by any combination of rows/columns/blocks house.
                    </li><br>

                    <u>For Fish 1 to 3, there is no overlap in BaseSet and CoverSet.</u><br><br>

                    <li>
                        Endo Fish: Fish with overlap in BaseSet.
                        The overlapped part is Endo Fin and is confirmed positively.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cannibalistic Fish: Fish with overlap in CoverSet. Overlapping parts are determined negatively.</li>
                    <li>Finned Fish: A Fish whose BaseSet is not partially covered by the CoverSet.</li><br>
                
                    <u>Fish 1 to 6 are configured by BaseSet and CoverSet by row/column/block house.</u>
                    
                    <hr width="60%" align="left"><br>
                    <li>(Finnedï¼‰Kraken Fish : Fish that applies eNetwork to links that break Locked.</li>
                    <li>LockedSet/ALS: Fish composed of house and digits. Finned LockedSet is ALS. A form of Fish expansion. </li>
                    <li>
                        General Logic: Row/Column/Block House plus cell digits 1-9 added to the element Fish. <br>
                        Many Sudoku analysis algorithms can be reconfigured using General Logic.
                    </li><br>
                    <u>LockedSet is configured by digits and row/column/block house.</u><br><br>
