         <p>
            Kraken (Finned)Fish is an algorithm that combines Fish with superlinks. 
            The explanation here uses a simple Fish expression, but Franken/Mutant the same goes for Fish.
            Furthermore, it also holds true for generalized BaseSet/CoverSet.<br>

            In Fish (figure on the left),
            if the circled X is true,
            one of the CoverSets that make up Fish will be set to false, which will cause Fish to break.
            In Finned Fish (figure on the right),
            if the circled X is true,
            one of the CoverSets that make up Fin and Fish will all be false, and Fish will be broken.<br>
         </p>

         <p>Expressed in another way,
            there is a weak link relationship between the circled X and the X of the CoverSet that makes up Fish.
            In the figure on the right, Fish with Finn also has a weak link with Fin.<br>
         </p>

         <p>
            Kraken (Finned)Fish is an analysis algorithm that extends the effect of a single link to a concatenation of links.
            Links can be superlinks (intercell links, AIC, ALS links).<br>
         </p>

         <p>
            Here is an example of Kraken (Finned)Fish. Kraken Fish is established for each highlighted digits in the cell. <br>
            However, a link column that indicates that a CoverSet constituent cell or Fin cell is false may be inconsistent
            when compared to itself or to other link columns.
            This is because the starting cell/digits is false.
