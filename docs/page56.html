			All Force-based algorithms use the current phase link.
			The links are used to build a chain and logically derive the truth of the cell candidates.
			<ol style="padding-left:20px">
				<li>A set X has one element true and the rest false. Which element is true is undetermined.</li>
				<li>A chain that starts with a true element determines the true/false of the elements led by the concatenation.</li>
				<li>In a chain starting with false element, the value of the derived element is uncertain (it can be true or false).</li>
				<li>For a chain that starts by assuming each element of set X to be true,
					if the truth value of element A that all chains lead to is the same, the truth of element A is determined.</li>
				<li>In a chain that starts by assuming that one element B of set X is true,
					the starting element B is determined to be false if multiple roots lead to unequal truth values for element C.</li>
			</ol>
		
			Set X is specifically rows, columns, blocks, and cells, as follows:<br><br>

			The (extended) link and chain structure of the Force method is relatively simple.
			It is also an efficient method of analysis. In other words, a good analysis algorithm for Sudoku.
			Forth algorithm is a logical algorithm.<br>
